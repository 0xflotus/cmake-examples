# The Examples

## Overview

There are three folders, each containing a library, and an application that uses that library (each top level folder is completely distinct).

The lion's share of the comments are in the _header-only_ folder, as that's the first of the three I created and the simplest of the bunch. Each CMakeLists.txt file for each library (_header-only_, _static_ and _dynamic_) contain a bunch of the same commands so I only explain them in their first use (mostly...) so do start with _header-only_ if you want to read through them. The recommended order would be _header-only_, _static_, _dynamic_.

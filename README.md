# Modern CMake Examples

## Overview

This repository is a collection of as-simple-as-possible CMake scripts (with a focus on installing).

The idea is to try and help understand exactly what each part of a CMakeLists.txt file does and why it is needed.

This is basically intended as a series of reminders to help me remember how to use CMake ðŸ¤¦

## CMake Resources

I've been attempting learn CMake for a while and have built up quite a list of articles/blogs/documentation that have helped inform my understanding up to this point. Please see them listed below (mainly for my benefit so I have them all in one place).
